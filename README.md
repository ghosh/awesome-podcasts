# Awesome Podcasts

> A curated list of podcasts for designers, developers, product managers, entrepreneurs, startups etc.

  
  
#### Note
Due to the nature of podcasts, it is difficult to cleanly classify them into different categories. Most podcast cover a wide range of topics and it blurs the boundries between topics. This is a very broad categorization and there is bound to be some overlap between categories. For example - You may find a podcast in the design category which also talks about lifestyle and business. Incase you disagree with the categorization and feel that a certain podcasts would be a better fit in a different category, please feel free to open an issue [here](https://github.com/Ghosh/awesome-podcasts/issues). Pull requests are most welcome.
